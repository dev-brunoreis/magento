# Commit message rules
- Always write commit messages in English
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive
- Use conventional commit format when possible (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Write in present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Adds" or "Adding")
